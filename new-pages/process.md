+ I learned this process as part of a workshop with *Hannah Fletcher* and *Land Art Collective*.

So as not to take away from Hannah's research, practice and expertise I won't be sharing the full process. But this is a loose step by step guide:

1. In 1 jar per sample create a sodium hydroxide solution
1. Grind + sieve sample, add to solutions. 
Agitate to extract organic matter.
1. Prepare filter paper
1. Create silver nitrate solution and add to shallow vessel.
1. Place filter paper in dish so it can absorb this.
1. Once spread, hang to dry in the dark.
1. Repeat capillary action with the soil solution on the now dry filter papers with the silver nitrate solution.
1. Dry, label and expose to sunlight 5- 7 days.
