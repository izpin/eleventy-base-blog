## My first project using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM)!

**The DOM is defined by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) as** <em>“the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.”</em>

**It is a** <em> “programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects."</em> This means programming and scripting languages can connect to and change a web page.

We can write in JavaScript (or another language such as Python) in order to use the DOM to access and dynamically manipulate elements and documents. Here, I'll be using JavaScript.

### The To-Do list project

This code-pen project creates a list of current to-dos as generated by a user. It accepts text data to create the content of the list, and requires that the user selects a priority option denoting the urgency of the task. The list builds top to bottom, with the newest added to the bottom. This most recent to-do is the only item with the class 'just-created'.

Project before user input:

  <img src="/img/tdl.png" class="codepen" alt="To-do list project without to-dos">
</a>

The to-do list with to-dos added:

</a>
 

**Components of the JavaScript code:**

1. Selectors get individual elements eg 'getElementById'.
1. Selector 'getElementsByClassName' to get a live list of elements with a specific class name: 'todo'. A 'live' list is a list that is dynamic and updates automatically as we add to-dos. It is like-an-array-but-not-really-an-array.
1. Event listeners for 'submit' collect text from the user once they have actively submitted it.
1. A custom function createTodo that creates a new text node using the user's text input then appends it to a list element and assigns it the class 'todo' to update the live list. This element is returned and we can insert in to the DOM by appending it to the unordered list element and actually create a to-do.
1. Calling the method reset() to clear the form for the next to-do.
1. As we only want to collect the input, not actually submit to a serve, we append the method preventDefault() to the parameter 'event' to stop the submit behaviour.
1. A second 'submit' event listener has a for loop to remove/add the class ‘just-created’ to the most recent to do, using the class name live list.	
    + I have used console.log to test and debug this.


**Features to add:**
+ Currently, the list doesn't display information about the priority selected. I can integrate this priority option value - to be illustrated using a combination of images and colour-coding.

<img src="https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/prettyoffice8/256/Flag-red.png" class="flag" alt="Red flag, high priority">

+ Add functionality that deletes to-dos as they’re completed
	+ Could do this with a 'click' event listener.
