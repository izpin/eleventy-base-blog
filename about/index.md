Soil chromatography is a photographic process that transforms a soil sample into an image showing its component organic matter. I’ve been thinking of these images as a kind of snapshot of a landscape.

It’s a slow process, from collecting samples during lockdown walks, to preparing the soil and filter paper, and exposing the image over several days, even weeks. As someone used to the immediacy of generating digital images and drawing with pencil on paper, being forced to wait for materials to develop has been a valuable learning experience. It’s a process I’m looking forward to learning about more deeply and experimenting with further.
