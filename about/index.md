## put together at some point 

Soil chromatography is a photographic process that transforms a soil sample into an image showing its component organic matter. I’ve been thinking of these images as a kind of snapshot of a landscape.

It’s a slow process, from collecting samples during lockdown walks, to preparing the soil and filter paper, and exposing the image over several days, even weeks. As someone used to the immediacy of generating digital images and drawing with pencil on paper, being forced to wait for materials to develop has been a valuable learning experience. It’s a process I’m looking forward to learning about more deeply and experimenting with further.

+ I learned this process as part of a workshop with *Hannah Fletcher* and *Land Art Collective*.

So as not to take away from Hannah's research, practice and expertise I won't be sharing the full process. But this is a loose step by step guide:

1. In 1 jar per sample create a sodium hydroxide solution
1. Grind + sieve sample, add to solutions. 
Agitate to extract organic matter.
1. Prepare filter paper
1. Create silver nitrate solution and add to shallow vessel.
1. Place filter paper in dish so it can absorb this.
1. Once spread, hang to dry in the dark.
1. Repeat capillary action with the soil solution on the now dry filter papers with the silver nitrate solution.
1. Dry, label and expose to sunlight 5- 7 days.
